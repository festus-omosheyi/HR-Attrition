# 📊 HR Attrition Analysis Project

This project explores HR attrition data using **Power BI** to uncover patterns and trends in employee turnover. Below is a documentary-style breakdown of the steps involved in the process.

---

## 🗂️ 1. Data Collection  
Collected structured HR datasets including employee details such as:
- Age, Gender, Department, Job Role  
- Marital Status, Income, Job Satisfaction  
- Attrition Status and more

---

## 🧹 2. Data Cleaning  
Performed data quality checks:
- Handled missing values (if any)  
- Standardized categorical entries  
- Verified data types (e.g., numbers vs text)

---

## 🔗 3. Data Modeling  
Established relationships between tables:
- Linked `Employee Info`, `Attrition`, `Job Roles`, `Age Bands`, etc.  
- Ensured relational integrity for seamless analysis

---

## 📌 4. KPI Setup  
Created essential KPIs for HR insights:
- Overall Attrition Rate  
- Employee Count  
- Average Monthly Income  
- Attrition distribution by Gender, Department, Marital Status

## 📈 5. Dashboard Visualization  
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with visuals:
- **Bar Charts** – Attrition by Department  
- **Donut Charts** – Gender & Marital Status Breakdown  
- **Line Graphs** – Attrition Trends (if time series available)  
- **Cards** – Key metrics at a glance

---

## 🔍 6. Storytelling with Insights  
Enhanced storytelling by:
- Adding filters and slicers for interactivity  
- Highlighting high-risk departments and demographics  
- Identifying patterns tied to dissatisfaction or low engagement

---

## 🧠 7. Conclusion & Recommendations  
Based on insights, proposed strategies to:
- Reduce attrition in affected departments
